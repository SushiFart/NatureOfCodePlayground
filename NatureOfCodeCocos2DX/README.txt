How to use the code:
The code is based on the Cocos2D-X and it assumes that you know how to set up a Cocos2D-X project for
your target platform. For more info on that visit the Cocos2D-X website:
http://www.cocos2d-x.org/wiki/Getting_Started_with_Cocos2d-x

After you have created your Cocos2D-X project you just simply copy the classes folder and replace the classes folder in
your Cocos2D-X project folder. After that follow the Cocos2D-X instructions how to set up and start using this project on your target platform.
