NatureOfCodePlayground
======================

A playground project to test and work on sample from the book The Nature Of Code in Swift and Cocos2d:

This is a playground project where I test and learn simulating real world scenarios based on the book THE NATURE OF CODE by Daniel Shiffman.

If find the book very interesting and decided to do the exercises and samples in the book with Swift, Cocos2D and Xcode for iOS Devices, just for the fun of it :).

This is currently a work in progress. Check out how the project is going and maybe you will find something help full in the sample code.
